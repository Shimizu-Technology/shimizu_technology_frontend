# Toast System Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to the toast notification system and how to implement them in your application.

## Improvements Made

1. **Swipe-to-Dismiss Functionality**: Users can now swipe toast notifications to dismiss them manually.
2. **Click-to-Dismiss**: All toasts can be dismissed by clicking on them.
3. **Toast Management System**: Prevents toast accumulation during high activity periods.
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Periodically checks for and removes stale toasts.
5. **Maximum Toast Limit**: Enforces a maximum number of visible toasts to prevent screen clutter.

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Update Your Root Component

Add the `ToastContainer` component to your root component (e.g., `App.tsx` or `RootApp.tsx`):

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ToastContainer } from '../shared/components/ToastContainer';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Your existing app content */}
      
      {/* Add the ToastContainer */}
      <ToastContainer />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 2. Using Toast Notifications

Continue using the toast utilities as before:

```tsx
import toastUtils from '../shared/utils/toastUtils';

// Show a success toast
toastUtils.success('Operation completed successfully');

// Show an error toast
toastUtils.error('An error occurred');

// Show a loading toast
const loadingToast = toastUtils.loading('Loading data...');
// Later dismiss it
loadingToast.dismiss();
// Or update it with a success message
loadingToast.success('Data loaded successfully');
```

## How It Works

1. The `ToastContainer` component wraps react-hot-toast's Toaster component with enhanced functionality.
2. CSS animations provide visual feedback for the swipe gesture.
3. A mutation observer watches for new toast elements and adds click handlers to them.
4. An interval timer periodically checks for and removes stale toasts.
5. The toast management system in `toastUtils.ts` prevents accumulation by tracking active toasts and enforcing a maximum limit.

## Customization

You can customize the toast appearance and behavior by passing props to the `ToastContainer` component:

```tsx
<ToastContainer 
  position="bottom-center" 
  reverseOrder={true}
  containerStyle={{ bottom: 60 }}
/>
```

Available customization options include:
- `position`: Where toasts appear on the screen
- `reverseOrder`: Whether to show newest toasts at the top or bottom
- `containerStyle`: Custom styles for the toast container
- `toastOptions`: Custom options for all toasts

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with toasts not disappearing:

1. Call `toastUtils.dismissAll()` to clear all toasts
2. Check for high CPU usage or JavaScript event loop congestion
3. Verify that the `ToastContainer` component is properly mounted in your application
